# 2021 BOSTON MAYORAL ELECTION
The Mayoral general election for Boston was held on Nov 2, 2021 between winner `Michelle Wu` and `Annissa Essaibi George`. The election results were post on Boston gov website in pdf format. I used `tabula` library in python with jupyter notebook to transform the pdf into csv. The original pdf results can be found here(https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2021/11/2021-11-02-21-Mayor.pdf). Github Actions and jupyter notebook automated the scraping and posted the csv files in the repo.

`2021_Bos_wards_precincts.csv` All 255 Precincts going from Ward 1 to Ward 22

`2021_Boston_Mayoral_Wards.csv` All 22 Wards plus the total votes cast
